In this revised version, I corrected the mistakes that I have made. 

I always believe we will learn from out mistakes, so that is the 
reason why you can find most of my repositories have a revised 
folder.

Revised sql file is the file that includes corrected answer, 
and the other is what I submitted and got graded.
